            <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>

            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
